# Maze-Game
An old prototype build of a game I made back in 9th grade in Unity for my school's exhibition. The finished build and code was erased from my school computers, so this particular build is not polished nor has the actual "characteristics" of an actual game (I tried to salvage whatever I could). I might try to find a newer build of my code or maybe even remake the whole game someday. Some parts of the code may not work as I just used a decompiler to extract the code classes.

I used the Recursive backtracking algorithm to randomly generate mazes every time the game is loaded. The enemies follow the player through a NavMesh which is dynamically generated after the generation of wall meshes (though they are very clunky).

THe executable file is in the "executable" branch and the code is in the "main" branch. Extract "MazeGamePC_Data.zip" and enjoy :)
